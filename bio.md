#Jesse Smidt#

**Where I live and my educational background:** I currently live in London, UK.  Back in 2012 I graduated with a B.S. in Business (Concentrating in Packaging & Logistics) and a Minor in Statistics from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, CA.
 
**Why I want a CS degree:** Shortly after graduation I began working for a large distributor and found myself continuously drawn to more technical projects while not having the background. It's always fun finding out what you originally studied isn't what you're interested in when it comes to application.

**Fun fact:** I've spent a lot of time living abroad in many different countries (Australia, Denmark, Germany, and the UK) and spent time visiting even more.
